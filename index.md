title: NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Generative AI and Creativity
description: A dialogue between machine learning researchers and creative professionals
---

Welcome to the **Generative AI and Creativity** workshop at NeurIPS 2024!
This workshop aims to bridge the gap between AI researchers and creative professionals, fostering mutual understanding and collaboration to address the impact of generative AI on creative fields.

The rapid advancement of generative AI technology has significantly affected various creative professions, from writing and visual art to music and performing arts. High-profile events such as the New York Times lawsuit against OpenAI and the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strike against Hollywood highlight the disconnect between AI developers and creative professionals. This workshop seeks to address this disconnect by fostering dialogue and collaboration between these communities.
The transformative potential of generative AI will only be fully realized when AI researchers gain a deeper understanding of the creative processes of human artists and develop constructive partnerships based on that understanding. This workshop aims to create such connections.

The workshop will cover a broad range of topics, including:

- Design of interactive, human-in-the-loop generative AI systems
- Detection of plagiarism and copying in image and text generation
- Tools to protect content creators from unwanted training
- Representational biases in training data and their effects
- Detection of AI-generated content and methods of evading detection
- Benchmarking "creativity" in generative AI systems
- Theories of data governance, provenance, and leverage
- Proposals for data licensing for AI training, especially for creative applications

We also invite creative submissions that critically engage with the use of AI in creative endeavors. The work can be generated with or without AI tools and can be "proof-of-concept". We seek work that sparks conversation about our relationship with AI and shows new ways of collaborating creatively with AI.

<div class="bio-text">
<a href="https://czhuang.github.io/"><b>Anna Huang</b></a>
is currently a Research Scientist at Magenta in Google DeepMind, focusing on generative models and human-AI partnerships in music creation. She created the ML model Coconet, which powered Google's first AI Doodle, the Bach Doodle, harmonizing 55 million melodies in two days. In 2018, she developed Music Transformer, a pioneering model for generating music with long-term structure, and the first successful adaptation of the transformer architecture to music. Her ICLR paper on Music Transformer is the most cited in music generation. She holds a Canada CIFAR AI Chair at Mila and serves as an adjunct professor at the University of Montreal. She has been involved in the AI Song Contest as a judge and organizer from 2020-2022. Her research interests include designing generative AI with an interaction-driven approach to enhance how we understand, learn, and create music. She collaborates with musicians to tailor AI systems to their creative practices, focusing on interpretability, explainability, and social reinforcement learning. She envisions interactive systems where musicians and AI can co-create, fostering creativity through interaction rather than imitation.
